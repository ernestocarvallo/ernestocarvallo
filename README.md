Solution Architect focused on building systems that are reliable, scalable, and practical in the real world.

I work at the intersection of **business needs and technical constraints** turning requirements into architectures that teams can actually build, operate, and evolve.

---

## What I Work On

- High-availability backend systems
- Payment systems and integrations
- Cloud and hybrid infrastructure
- Service migration from on-prem to cloud
- System design reviews and trade-off analysis

---

## Current Focus

- **QRIS (Indonesia payment system)**
- **VISA authentication & payment flows**
- **CMS platforms**
- **Migrating existing services to the cloud**

These projects involve security, performance, compliance, and uptime where small mistakes become big problems.

## How I Approach Architecture

- Start with the problem, not the technology
- Design for failure, not best-case scenarios
- Keep systems understandable and operable
- Prefer simple solutions that scale over clever ones
- Question requirements before they turn into incidents

---

## What You’ll Find Here

- Architecture focused repositories
- Design notes and decision documentation
- Practical experiments around scalability and reliability
- Minimal code used to prove architectural ideas

---

I value systems that are boring in production and easy to reason about.  
If it’s complex, it should be complex for a reason.
